Our team, named ‘Live Infinitely,’ acted as consultants for ‘Mingar,’ a virtual Canadian fitness tracker/watch company. Our task was to analyze customer data in the fitness watch market. We received partial data from Mingar and collected additional data through web scraping, API access, and licensed data sources. We then merged, cleaned, visualized, summarized, and built models with this data to meet the client’s requirements.</p> <p><strong>You can find more details about this capstone project</strong> &lt;a href=“https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-final-project/outsiders.html” target=”_blank”&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</p> <p>For this project, Mingar sought our guidance to develop strategies for two new product lines, “Active” and “Advance,” with the goal of increasing their market share in the wearables market. Mingar’s product range spans from maritime/military GPS devices to high-end fitness trackers. To capture a larger share of the fitness-tracking wearables market, Mingar expanded its product range to target lower-income customer segments. Additionally, the client wanted us to address complaints about device performance for users with darker skin.</p> <p>Our analysis was divided into two main sections: a Consecutive Summary and a Technical Report.  In our analysis, we focused on:</p> <p>(i) Providing the marketing team with insights into the audience for the new “Active” and “Advance” products and understanding the differences between the customers of the new and old products. We also examined income disparities between these customer groups.</p> <p>(ii) Assisting the social media team by analyzing trends in user complaints, particularly related to device performance and variations based on customers’ skin color. This analysis aimed to enhance user experiences with Mingar’s devices.</p> <p>To meet the client’s requests, we conducted a deep dive into the data, working with a dataset containing over 50,000 customer records. Our analysis included data cleaning, diverse data visualizations, and the application of various statistical methods, including hypothesis tests, linear models, linear mixed models, generalized linear models, and model selection. Our findings were presented in a comprehensive statistical report on Mingar’s marketing and product considerations, utilizing data from both the client and external sources. In summary, our project involved using data-driven approaches to provide valuable insights and recommendations to Mingar, helping them navigate the competitive wearables market and improve their products and marketing strategies.</p> <p><strong>Check the full report</strong> &lt;a href=“/assets/pdf/mingar.pdf” target=”_blank”&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</p> <p><br></p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure class="text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/mingar1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/mingar1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/mingar1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/mingar1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <figcaption class="caption"> The consulting report </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br></p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure class="text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/mingar2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/mingar2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/mingar2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/mingar2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <figcaption class="caption"> A structure overview of the report </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </body></html>
