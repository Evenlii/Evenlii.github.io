### About Me

Hi! I'm Yiwen Li, but you can call me Even. I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>, earning an Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics and Economics. Currently, I'm a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.hku.hk/" target="_blank">University of Hong Kong</a>, working under the supervision of <a href="https://borisbabic.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Boris Babic</a>. My research primarily focuses on developing robust machine learning models for high-dimensional and complex data, especially in scenarios with limited structured information.

During my senior year at the University of Toronto, I engaged in several innovative research projects, primarily in reliable machine learning and its medical applications, under the mentorship of <a href="https://borisbabic.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Boris Babic</a>. I was also privileged to join <a href="https://shuiblue.github.io/forcolab-uoft/team.html" target="_blank">FORCOLAB</a>, where I explored the regulatory and ethical dimensions of AI in healthcare and is co-supervised by <a href="https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~shuruiz/" target="_blank">Prof. Shurui Zhou</a>. In the summer of 2023, I received a fellowship from the <a href="https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Data Science Institute </a> at the University of Toronto, serving as a Summer Research Scholar under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jgronsbell/home" target="_blank">Prof. Jessica Gronsbell</a>. Currently, as a Research Assistant at HKU, I'm playing a key role in developing the new MA program <a href="https://www.maaies.arts.hku.hk/programme-information" target="_blank">'AI, Ethics and Society</a>.'

My industry experiences have been equally rewarding. In the summer of 2022, I interned as a Data Analyst at <a href="https://www.unionpayintl.com/en/" target="_blank">UnionPay</a>, where I applied quantitative skills to tackle real-world data challenges. Following this, I joined <a href="https://corporate.jd.com/" target="_blank">JD.com, Inc</a>. as a Data Analyst Intern, furthering my pursuit of reliable data-driven solutions through statistical and computational methods. 

### Some Fun Facts
Beyond the world of data, I'm passionate about travel, music, cooking, photography, and filmmaking. I love using photography and micro-films to record my life and advocate for social issues. As a <a href="https://swe.org/" target="_blank">Society of Women Engineers </a> (SWE) member, I'm particularly interested in supporting women in STEM fields. Music is my solace and creative outlet; I started playing piano at the age of 3 and am now trying music composition.


### Research Interests
- **Machine Learning:** Interpretable and reliable ML for high-dimensional and incomplete real-world data
