Starting in the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of being invited by Prof. Boris Babic to actively contribute to the development of the new **MA program in AI, Ethics, and Society** at HKU. In this role, I was responsible for creating and shaping the core course **"Fundamentals of AI, Data, and Algorithms."** This course aimed to provide students with a strong foundation in the technical aspects of artificial intelligence and big data technologies. I meticulously designed and developed comprehensive course materials, including slides, case studies, and coding files. These materials covered a wide range of data science topics, such as Probability, Bayes Inference, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Large Language Models, and R programming.

## About the program

The newly launched MA program in AI, Ethics, and Society at HKU offers a rigorous curriculum that combines both theoretical and practical approaches. Students enrolled in this program gain a profound understanding of the ethical, social, political, and economic implications of AI. They also acquire the skills to apply this knowledge in various contexts, including policy-making, business strategy, ethical design, and creative industries.

This program adopts an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from various fields, including philosophy, computer science, social sciences, law, political science, and humanities. Graduates and professionals completing this program will be well-equipped with the knowledge and skills required to navigate the AI revolution and make a positive impact in their respective fields.

## The core course: Fundamentals of AI, Data and Algorithms 

Within the program, my main responsibility is to help construct the core course ‘Fundamentals of AI, Data and Algorithms’ under the supervision of Prof. Boris Babic, who is the course instructor. This core course presents the technical fundamentals of artificial intelligence and big data technologies, and how these are applied across a range of domains and sectors, such as medicine, business, and government. It provides a thorough understanding of the current capabilities and status of these technologies. Focus will be on fundamentals that are relevant to understanding the philosophical import, and ethical, social, and political implications of AI and big data. The course will cover the basics of a range of topics, which may include: large language models, neural networks, deep learning, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, knowledge-based agents, natural language processing, Bayesian learning, data analysis, statistical inference, decision theory, game theory, amongst other topics. The core competencies targeted by this course are a conceptual understanding of the way modern artificial intelligence systems operate, and a basic understanding of the tools used for understanding their import.
