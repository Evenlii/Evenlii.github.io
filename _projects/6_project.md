## About this project

This is the capstone project for the course “ENT200 Innovation and Entrepreneurship’ delivered at the University of Toronto. In a group of 5-7 students, our goal is to develop a comprehensive and innovative business plan, and conduct market research and analysis to evaluate whether the proposed business can successfully enter and disrupt the existing market. The detailed analysis and presentations would seek to show potential investors that the idea has been considered comprehensively.

## Our business idea

In recent years, air travel has experienced significant growth, leading to an increased demand for convenient and affordable accommodations near airports. As Pearson Airport continues to serve as a major transportation hub, travelers frequently encounter high-priced hotels and poor sound insulation in the surrounding area. This predicament is especially inconvenient for young travelers with layovers or early flights, as they struggle to find suitable places to rest.

To address this pressing issue, our team has conducted an in-depth feasibility research study to explore the potential of opening a capsule hotel within Pearson Airport's vicinity. Our innovative capsule hotel concept aims to combine state-of-the-art soundproofing technology, modern amenities, and an affordable, hourly-based pricing model. This business venture is designed to cater to the needs of young travelers seeking comfortable, budget-friendly accommodations during layovers, delayed flights, or before early departures.


## The feasibility report


Our report comprises three main sections:

(i) Product/Service Feasibility Analysis: Concept testing, target consumer identification, marketability, product usefulness, and first-mover advantages.

(ii) Industry/Market Feasibility Analysis: Industry attractiveness, niche market identification, and market timeliness.

(iii) Organizational and Financial Feasibility Analysis: Management prowess, resource sufficiency, and capital requirements.


Through comprehensive market analysis, financial projections, and thorough examinations of customer needs, our report will demonstrate the viability of establishing a capsule hotel at Pearson Airport. This pioneering solution has the potential to transform the travel experience for countless individuals, ensuring their comfort and convenience during their journeys.

## Key findings

Our analysis suggests the feasibility of a 12-capsule trial operation at Toronto Pearson Airport, considering market demand, competition, financial sustainability, and expected revenue from room rates. However, several contingencies must be addressed:

* Collaborations: Partnering with established airport hotels or hospitality companies could reduce initial costs and provide industry insights.
* Staff Training: Cooperation with existing capsule hotel brands for efficient training could enhance operational efficiency.
* Location Flexibility: Starting at a less busy airport may offer a better environment for testing and refining our business model.
* Diverse Offerings: Expanding services and amenities to cater to a broader customer base, including specific products for the LGBTQ community, disabled individuals, and military personnel.
  
In conclusion, while the capsule hotel at Toronto Pearson Airport is feasible under certain conditions, success requires adaptability, strategic partnerships, and continuous market analysis. Our team is committed to a holistic approach, balancing innovative ideas with practical business strategies.
