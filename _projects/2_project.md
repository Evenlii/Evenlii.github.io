## Background and Goals

As technology evolves rapidly in recent times, medical devices are now playing a crucial role in diagnosing, treating, and monitoring medical conditions. From simple tools like blood pressure monitors to recent innovations like robotic surgeries, medical devices impact nearly every facet of patient care, significantly advancing therapeutic capabilities and improving the overall quality of life for individuals. With the rapid emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, the integration of AI has transformed the scope and utility of medical devices. AI technologies offer the capability to process vast volumes of data, identify complex patterns, and generate valuable insights with remarkable accuracy, augmenting medical devices to unprecedented levels.\\

Companies and healthcare institutions are increasingly adopting AI-based medical devices to harness data-driven insights and provide more accurate and timely medical interventions. However, the adoption of AI into medical devices also introduces critical considerations and challenges around existing regulatory frameworks, data-related concerns, bias issues, algorithmic transparency, system security, clinical trust, and ethical development practices. Without diligent focus on these impacts, AI systems risk exacerbating disparities and inequities. Active commitment to ethical, trustworthy AI that centers patient interests is imperative. In this case, finding a balance between innovation and patient safety is paramount in this journey toward AI-enabled medical devices. \\

In light of these potential challenges, our project provides a high-level overview of the key challenges faced by AI-enabled medical devices in healthcare. The focus is on summarizing the core issues and concerns that span technological, ethical, regulatory, and social domains, highlighting the need to establish a more sophisticated regulation framework.

## Two central research questions:

(i) Who are the key stakeholders involved in the AI-based medical devices development lifecycle, and what roles do they play?
(ii) What are the primary challenges associated with implementing AI in medical devices, particularly in terms of ethics, regulation, and technology?

## Methodology

- **Literature Review**: This comprehensive study was conducted through a meticulous literature review, utilizing databases such as Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. The research process involved systematic keyword searches and the careful selection of relevant papers, focusing on AI in healthcare. A total of 34 papers were chosen based on their relevance to the research questions. These included research studies, review papers, case studies, and expert analyses, providing a rich and diverse range of perspectives on the subject. Additionally, the project employed qualitative analysis methods to identify common themes and challenges presented in the literature.
- **Interview**: We also conduct interviews with
