“Those around me believed that aspiring to be a dancer was not a pursuit befitting a young man, yet it was only on stage, through dance, that I truly realized who I am.” During my junior high years, I studied Latin dance for three years, where I met my dance partner, Ke, who also became one of my closest friends. Unlike other students in our Latin dance class, Ke had no parental backing for his interest in Latin dance. For long, dance was deemed more appropriate for girls, while boys were expected to have more 'masculine' hobbies. Fortunately, Ke's natural talent for Latin dance was recognized by our school's dance instructor, who became his sole pillar of support, offering him the opportunity to learn. This was my first direct experience with the adverse effects of gender-based prejudice in the real world, extending the bias beyond discrimination and limitations faced by women.

Our heartfelt micro-film ‘Breaking Rhythms’ tells the story of Alan, a high school boy who has always dreamt of becoming a professional Latin dancer and gracing larger stages. Hailing from a modest background, Alan and his father depend solely on each other. His father's only wish for him is to excel academically to secure a prosperous future. However, Alan harbors a deep-seated passion for Latin dance. Guilt-ridden due to his family's financial constraints, he fears burdening his father and thus, practices Latin dance secretly in his spare time, aspiring to one day shine on a grand stage and prove his worth as a dancer. However, Alan's journey is fraught with challenges. Yet, Alan's path is fraught with obstacles. He endures ridicule, bullying, and ostracization from peers who fail to understand his passion. When Alan's father discovers his son's clandestine practice, anger erupts, and he vehemently forbids Alan from pursuing dance. The lack of support plunges Alan into self-doubt and near surrender of his dance aspirations. In a poignant moment, as Alan decides to bid farewell to Latin dance in the school's dance room, he discovers a note and a new pair of Latin dance shoes left by his teacher. It turns out his teacher had been quietly observing Alan's dedication and was impressed by his determination and talent. The teacher informs Alan of an upcoming dance competition in the city and encourages him to take the first brave step, offering the support he needs. Bolstered by this encouragement, Alan rekindles his efforts, training more diligently, and ultimately triumphs at the dance competition. During the final applause, Alan spots his father standing and clapping in the audience. His teacher had reached out to Alan's father beforehand, persuading him to witness his son's radiant performance. Amidst the thunderous applause, Alan's ears resonate with the crisp yet powerful claps of his father.

Our film crew is composed of nine dedicated members, and I am honored to have taken on the role of director and lead screenwriter. In this micro-film, we adopt a third-person narrative perspective, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the journey of our protagonist, Alan, as he passionately pursues his dream in Latin dance. Through this lens, we vividly depict the obstacles, self-doubts, and unexpected support that shape Alan's transformation from fervent determination to moments of melancholic indecision, ultimately culminating in unwavering resolve.
The narrative unfolds through a skillful use of flashbacks, commencing with a scene of Alan poised to perform on stage and subsequently retracing his initial fascination with Latin dance. In terms of visual storytelling, we employ a predominantly dark color palette to mirror the internal struggles faced by our protagonist, creating a stark contrast with the external world he inhabits. We place particular emphasis on capturing the sequences of Alan's training in the dance room, not only showcasing his remarkable dance talent but also highlighting his unwavering perseverance—a stark contrast to his demeanor when facing his peers outside the dance room.
